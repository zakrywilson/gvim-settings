# gVim-settings

The settings I use for Windows gVim when I can't use Linux.

## Color scheme

The color scheme used in this setup is called `hybrid_material` and can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/kristijanhusak/vim-hybrid-material/blob/master/colors/hybrid_material.vim).

## How to use

* Copy the `_vimrc` file into your `Vim` directory, replacing the preexisting one.
* Download `hybrid_material` and drop the `hybrid_material.vim` file into your `Vim\vim<version>\colors` directory.
* Restart gVim.
